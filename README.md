Welcome to my repository for my undergraduate thesis project! This study examines how children learn to answer questions containing 'who' and 'how' in the context of negation ('n't' and 'not') as well as in the context of communication verbs with differing control properties ('ask' and 'promise').

Originally, the study was launched on [Lookit.com](https://lookit.mit.edu/), an experimental platform designed by MIT's Early Childhood Cognition Lab. Currently, the study is collecting data from adult participants.
